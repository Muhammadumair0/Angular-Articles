    "description": "When you write a product description with a huge crowd of buyers in mind, your descriptions become wishy-washy and you end up addressing no one at all.The best product descriptions address your ideal buyer directly and personally. You ask and answer questions as if youâ€™re having a conversation with them. You choose the words your ideal buyer uses. You use the word you.   This is how Think Geek starts the product description of an LED Flashlight.When it comes to writing your own product descriptions, start by imagining your ideal buyer. What kind of humor does he or she appreciate (if any)? What words does he use? What words does he hate? Is he okay with words like sucky and crappy? What questions does he ask that you should answer? Consider how you would speak to your ideal buyer if you were selling your product in store, face-to-face. Now try and incorporate that language into your website so you can have a similar conversation online that resonates more deeply."
